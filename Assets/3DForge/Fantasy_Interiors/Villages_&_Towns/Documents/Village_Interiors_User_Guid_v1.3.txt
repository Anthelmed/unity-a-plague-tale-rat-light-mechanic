Please would you take aa minte and STAR rate the package and possibly write aa review of what you found when you opened the package.

Mobile & Desktop:
The textures sheets has intuative atlas textures usage with a huge amount of prefabs reading of each textures sheet.
The groupig was done if such a way that say all the wooden furniture can be used with another project a with eaze.
This will assit with lowered draw calls aspecially when using Static Batching or MeshCombine functions.

Also, all the screenshots and DEMOS that you have seen has been achieved with a Diffuse map only,
so no funnies that a mobile device might not be able to display.

The scenes that was used for the screenshots are all inside the Demo Scenes directory.
